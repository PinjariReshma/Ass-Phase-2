        <h2>Total Solar Eclipse 2024: Why this rare event will not repeat for
            126 years:</h2>
        <p>The Total Solar Eclipse of 2024 is set to offer a rare astronomical
            phenomenon that won't happen again for another 126 years. <br>

            On April 8, 2024, day will briefly turn into night as the moon
            passes directly between the Earth and the sun, casting its shadow
            and enveloping parts of North America in darkness. <br>

            While solar eclipses occur about every 18 months somewhere on Earth,
            the path of totality is relatively narrow, and any given location
            will only experience a total eclipse every few hundred years on
            average.</p>

        <p>Totality refers to the brief period during a solar eclipse when the
            moon completely covers the disk of the sun, leaving only the sun's
            outer atmosphere, known as the corona, visible. During totality, the
            sky darkens significantly, resembling twilight, and observers may
            witness the stars and planets becoming visible during the day.</p>
