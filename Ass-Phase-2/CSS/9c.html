        <h1>MOON</h1>
        <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average
            distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), about 30 times the diameter of
            Earth. Over time Earth's gravity has caused tidal locking, causing
            the same side of the Moon to always face Earth. Because of this, the
            lunar day and the lunar month are the same length, at 29.5 Earth
            days. The Moon's gravitational pull – and to a lesser extent, the
            Sun's – are the main drivers of Earth's tides.</p>
