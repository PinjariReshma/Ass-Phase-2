            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or
                software, as opposed to the intelligence of living beings,
                primarily of humans. It is a field of study in computer science
                that develops and studies intelligent machines. Such machines
                may be called AIs.

                AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government,
                and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced web
                search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems
                (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), interacting via human
                speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa), self-driving
                cars (e.g., Waymo), generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT
                and AI art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games
                (e.g., chess and Go).[1]</p>
